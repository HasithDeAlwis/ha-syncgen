// rootCmd represents the base command when called without any subcommands
var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "syncgen",
	Short: "PostgreSQL High Availability synchronization and failover automation tool",
	Long: `syncgen is a command-line tool for setting up and managing PostgreSQL high availability
configurations using file-level synchronization and automated failover mechanisms.

The tool generates the necessary scripts, configuration files, and systemd services to
establish a primary-replica PostgreSQL setup with:
- Automated file synchronization using rsync over SSH
- Real-time monitoring and health checks
- Automatic failover to replica on primary failure
- SSH key-based authentication for secure data transfer
- Configurable sync intervals and retry policies

Usage examples:
  syncgen validate ha-config.yaml # Validate configuration
  syncgen build [config file]               # Generate HA scripts and configuration
  //  COMING SOON
  syncgen status                           # Check current HA status
  syncgen failover                         # Manual failover to replica

	// Global configuration flags that apply to all subcommands
	// These flags will be available across all ha-syncgen commands

	// Config file flag - allows users to specify custom config location
	// Default behavior will look for config in a standard location:
	// 1. ./cluster.yaml (current directory)
	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default searches standard locations)")

	// Verbose output flag for debugging and detailed operation logs
	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().BoolVarP(&verbose, "verbose", "v", false, "enable verbose output for debugging")

	// Dry-run flag to preview operations without making actual changes
	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().BoolVar(&dryRun, "dry-run", false, "preview operations without executing them")
}
